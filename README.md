This is an open source Java implementation of Okey Game, created by Denizhan Soydas.

The game is not a complete Okey game to play.
This is just an A.I. that uses DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING to find which player is closest to win.

For simulation, it only shuffles the tiles, distributes them and then says who is the closest to win after it.
